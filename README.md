## basicbits (A Go web app, just the basic, but it works)

Sometimes all you want is a template you can follow when you.know != enough.

basicbits gets you up and running fast so you can experiment. Don't waste time, get what you need.

This is something you should take and reshape to your own needs.

I hope you build something awesome.

## Getting it running

We're running on windows, but you can make this work basically anywhere. In your shell of choice:

```bash
yourpath\go\src\github.com\DIS-SIN\gobasicbits>go build

yourpath\go\src\github.com\DIS-SIN\gobasicbits>gobasicbits
Init: Basic Models Initialized!
Init: Basic Database Initialized!
Init development Webserver
bbmodels: no-op success
bbdatabase: no-op success
Starting webserver on port 8080
```

Then in your browser of choice:

```bash
http://localhost:8080/
```

You should see your app, try saying/typing something to it. It should "process it" and send it back.

Just imagine what you can build!

Now go do it!
